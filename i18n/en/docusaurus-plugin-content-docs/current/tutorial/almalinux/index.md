## Introduction
AlmaLinux is an Open Source, free forever, community-maintained Linux distribution with a focus on long-term stability and a reliable, production-grade platform. The AlmaLinux operating system is compatible with RHEL®. The AlmaLinux OS Foundation was established as a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization to manage the ownership and governance of the project. The Foundation includes over 400 individual members, over 100 Mirror sponsors, and over 25 corporate sponsors.

## AlmaLinux Binary Compatible
What is Binary Compatible?
AlmaLinux being “binary compatible” with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) means that applications and software designed for RHEL can run on AlmaLinux without the need for modification or recompilation. This is because AlmaLinux is built from RHEL source code and is designed to have an identical binary structure and format, so applications built for one system can be used on another.
