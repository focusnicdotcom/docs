The **PHP Slim** framework is a lightweight, fast, and efficient micro-framework for building RESTful-based web applications and APIs. In this guide, we will discuss in a **comprehensive, structured, and in-depth** way how to **install the Slim Framework** using **LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)** on the **AlmaLinux 8** operating system, an enterprise distro that is the successor to CentOS.

## Prerequisites

- Full root access
- Domain (optional)
- Basic Linux Command Line

## Preparation

:::danger
Make sure the firewall and SELinux have been adjusted or temporarily disabled if you want to avoid problems during the initial installation.
:::

Before starting the Slim installation, make sure your AlmaLinux 8 server is up to date and ready to install the LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP).
```
dnf update -y
dnf install epel-release -y
```

### Install Apache

Apache is a reliable web server and is widely used in production environments. To install it, run the following command:
```
dnf install httpd -y
```
Once the installation is complete, enable and start the Apache service with the following command:
```
systemctl enable --now httpd
```
To allow access to the server via HTTP and HTTPS, allow the firewall:
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service={http,https}
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Install PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side programming language that is crucial in this stack. We will install PHP 8 from the Remi Repository to use the latest version of PHP.

Run the following command to install the Remi Repository:
```
dnf install -y https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm
```
Then list the available PHP using the following command:
```
dnf module list php
```
Output example:
```

Hint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled
```
Enable the desired PHP module version. For example, for PHP 8.4, run the following command:
```
dnf module reset php -y
dnf module enable php:remi-8.4 -y
```
Once the repository is active, we can proceed with installing PHP along with the commonly used essential modules:
```
dnf install -y php php-cli php-common php-mysqlnd php-fpm php-opcache php-gd php-curl php-mbstring php-xml php-json php-soap php-bcmath
```
Check the installed PHP version with the following command:
```
php -v
```

### Install MariaDB

MariaDB is a replacement for MySQL and is compatible with MySQL-based applications. Run the following command to install it:
```
dnf module list mariadb
```
Output example:
```
AlmaLinux 8 - AppStream
Name                                Stream                               Profiles                                               Summary                                   
mariadb                             10.3 [d]                             client, galera, server [d]                             MariaDB Module                            
mariadb                             10.5                                 client, galera, server [d]                             MariaDB Module                            
mariadb                             10.11                                client, galera, server [d]                             MariaDB Module                            

Hint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled
```
The output above shows that the default version of MariaDB is 10.11 (the latest version from the OS). However, we'll use MariaDB version 11.4.7 using the official repository at https://mariadb.org/download/ and then reset MariaDB to remove it from the OS's default repository:
```
dnf module reset mariadb
```
Run the following command to add the MariaDB version 11.4.7 repository:
```
nano /etc/yum.repos.d/MariaDB.repo
```
Add the following parameters:
```
# MariaDB 11.4 RedHatEnterpriseLinux repository list - created 2025-07-31 14:04 UTC
# https://mariadb.org/download/
[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
# rpm.mariadb.org is a dynamic mirror if your preferred mirror goes offline. See https://mariadb.org/mirrorbits/ for details.
# baseurl = https://rpm.mariadb.org/11.4/rhel/$releasever/$basearch
baseurl = https://mirror.its.dal.ca/mariadb/yum/11.4/rhel/$releasever/$basearch
module_hotfixes = 1
# gpgkey = https://rpm.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgkey = https://mirror.its.dal.ca/mariadb/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck = 1
```
Then run the following command to install MariaDB:
```
dnf install MariaDB-server MariaDB-client
```
Enable and activate the MariaDB service:
```
systemctl enable --now mariadb
systemctl status mariadb
```
Before using it for production or testing, it is best to secure the MariaDB installation first by running the following command:
```
mariadb-secure-installation
```
Then follow the instructions that appear:

- Enter current password for root (enter for none) → **[ENTER]**
- Switch to unix_socket authentication → **Y**
- Change the root password? → **Y**
- Remove anonymous users? → **Y**
- Disallow root login remotely? **Y**
- Remove test database and access to it? **Y**
- Reload privilege tables now? **Y**

## Install Slim

Before installing Slim, we'll first create a virtual host and database (to store Slim's content, configuration, and structure). Run the following command to create a virtual host:
:::info
Because the Slim Framework is minimalist, it doesn't have a built-in ORM or database connection like Laravel or Symfony.
:::

:::info
Make sure you're using a valid domain (FQDN) and that the DNS A record is pointed to the server IP address used on your server.
:::

```
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/focusnic.biz.id.conf
```

Fill in the following parameters:
```jsx showLineNumbers title="/etc/httpd/conf.d/focusnic.biz.id.conf"
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@focusnic.biz.id
    ServerName focusnic.biz.id
    ServerAlias www.focusnic.biz.id
    DocumentRoot /var/www/focusnic.biz.id/slimapp/public

    <Directory /var/www/focusnic.biz.id>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/focusnic.biz.id-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/focusnic.biz.id-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Then create a directory on the virtualhost above:
```
mkdir -p /var/www/focusnic.biz.id
```

Restart Apache to save changes:
```
apachectl configtest
systemctl restart httpd
```

Download Composer and install it with the following command:

:::info
Composer will be required for Slim management, such as installing dependencies and other requirements during development or production.
:::

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
Check composer version:
```
composer --version
```
Output example:
```
Composer version 2.8.10 2025-07-10 19:08:33
PHP version 8.4.11 (/usr/bin/php)
```

Download the Slim file and place it in the directory according to the virtualhost, we will download Slim and create a project with the name `slimapp` using composer:

```
cd /var/www/focusnic.biz.id/
composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton slimapp
```
Adjust permissions on the Slim directory:
```
find /var/www/focusnic.biz.id/slimapp -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find /var/www/focusnic.biz.id/slimapp -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/focusnic.biz.id
```

Access the Slim installation via a browser, for example: `http://focusnic.biz.id`. If the installation is successful, the following default Slim page will appear. <br/>
![](/img/almalinux8-lamp-apps-slim1.jpg)<br/>

## Troubleshooting

1. 404 Not Found <br/>
Ensure Apache's `mod_rewrite` is enabled and `.htaccess` is used.

2. Slim Not Responding <br/>
Ensure the `index.php` file is written correctly and the dependency via Composer has been successfully installed.

3. Permission Denied <br/>
Ensure the Apache user's directory is `apache:apache` or has been chown to your user.

4. Autoload Error <br/>
Rerun composer install if the vendor file is missing.

## Conclusion

The Slim PHP Framework provides a **fast, lightweight, and powerful** solution for building web-based applications and APIs. By following this comprehensive guide, we successfully installed the **Slim Framework using the LAMP Stack on AlmaLinux 8** with an **optimal and secure** configuration.

The step-by-step instructions, from installing LAMP and Composer to configuring the Apache virtual host, are explained in **detail and systematically** so that even beginners can follow along easily.

Q: Is the Slim Framework suitable for large applications? <br/>
A: Slim is designed as a micro-framework, but with its modular architecture, it is possible to use it for large applications with the addition of external components.

Q: Can it be used with Nginx? <br/>
A: Yes, Slim can run on top of Nginx, but this guide focuses on using Apache as part of a LAMP Stack.

Q: Is Composer mandatory? <br/>
A: It is mandatory. Composer is the primary dependency manager in the modern PHP ecosystem, including Slim.

Q: How do I deploy to production? <br/>
A: Use a valid domain, enable HTTPS, optimize the Apache configuration, and run the application in production mode.

Q: Is AlmaLinux suitable for production? <br/>
A: Absolutely. AlmaLinux is a stable successor to CentOS and is supported by the enterprise community.
