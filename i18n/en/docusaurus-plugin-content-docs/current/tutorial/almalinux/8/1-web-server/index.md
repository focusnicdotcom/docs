A web server is software or hardware responsible for storing, managing, and serving website content to users over the internet. A web server receives requests from browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.), processes them, and then returns the requested web page to the user.

Examples of web servers:

- **Apache**: One of the most popular and widely used web servers worldwide, supporting various operating systems.
- **Nginx**: A web server known for its speed and efficiency.
- **LiteSpeed**: A capable replacement for Apache without requiring configuration or application changes.

A web server stores all the files that make up a website, such as HTML files, images, videos, and so on. When a user accesses a website, the browser sends a request to the web server. The web server receives and processes the request. After processing the request, the web server delivers the requested content to the user's browser in the form of a web page. The web server is also responsible for managing the connection between the user and the website, ensuring that all requests are served efficiently.
