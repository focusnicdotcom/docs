Efficiently managing Apache web servers in a production environment requires a robust monitoring and logging strategy. On AlmaLinux 8-based systems, this process not only helps detect problems in real time but also improves server security, performance, and resilience.

Logging is an essential component for any system administrator. In Apache, there are two main types of logs to be aware of:

- **Access Log**: Records all HTTP requests to the server.

- **Error Log**: Records errors and warnings that occur during Apache operations.
